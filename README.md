# dss-vim-syntax
OpenDSS syntax highlighting (`*.dss` files) is only available for Notepad++ in the default installation.
This breaks the workflow for some delvelopment styles.

These files enable basic syntax highlighting in vim.

## Installation instructions for Linux:
1. Copy the file `/syntax/dss.vim` to `~/.vim/syntax/`
1. Copy the file `/ftdetect/dss.vim` to `~/.vim/ftdetect/`
1. You may have to create these folders if they don't already exist 

And that's it!
